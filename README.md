Here are some notes and solutions of the books I read.

I know maybe I should open a blog to store this kind of stuff but currently I'm too lazy to learn and set up my github pages. So currently this repository will do the work and I hope maybe someday I will open my blog.

**Notes** 

Notes mainly contain 2 kinds of knowledges: some concepts which is baisc or new to me, something that confueses me. So eventually these notes will be very personal and very small subset of the corresponding book. You can read my notes as a reminder, but if you really want to learn from the book, I strongly recommend you to finish reading the book, just use my notes as a small companion.

**Solutions**

Some of the books in the list provide exercise problems. Maybe there is an official/unofficial solution manual available on the internet. I also provide my version. Keep in mind the correctness of the solutions here is never guaranteed due to the obvious limitation of my ability.

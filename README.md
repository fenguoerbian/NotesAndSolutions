Here are some notes and solutions of the books I read.

I know maybe I should open a blog to store this kind of stuff but currently I'm too lazy to learn and set up my github pages. So currently this repository will do the work and I hope maybe someday I will open my blog.

Book lists of what I'm currently reading or planning to read:

* Quantile Regression by Roger Koenker
* A Probability Path by Sidney I. Resnick
* Introduction To Topology by Bert Mendelson
* Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe
